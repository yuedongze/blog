Hi, you found me.

## Personal Info

My name is Steven Yue (or Dongze Yue on paper). I'm a Software Engineer in the Cryptographic Remediation team at [SandboxAQ](https://www.sandboxaq.com). 

I'm also an incoming PhD student in the [Applied and Provable Security Group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/applied-and-provable-security) at [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/) (Eindhoven University of Technology) where I'm super glad to be advised by [Andreas HÃ¼lsing](https://huelsing.net/wordpress/). Previously, I had my Master's degree from UC Berkeley and Bachelor's degree from Cornell University.

I'm also a proud father of [Kiwi](https://www.instagram.com/kiwi.the.mame/), a Mame Shiba Inu from Japan.
